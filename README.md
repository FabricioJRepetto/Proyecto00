Readme WIP:

the Dawn of the Dogs.

This project is my first aproach to front-end and back-end development. React and Redux compose the web app. The user can search dog breeds by aplying multiple dynamic filters and create their own custom breeds, which will be stored on the data base and be shown beside the other API results. The back-end was built with Express, Sequelize and Postgresql. Using an external API as reference, an SQL database was created to storage the custom dogs entries, making that feature possible.
